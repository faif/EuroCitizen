EuroCitizen is a Web Ontology written in OWL. I designed the EuroCitizen ontology using Protégé as a part of my BSc thesis which was related with the Semantic Web.

The Semantic Web is Tim Berners Lee's vision about the World Wide Web. It is about extending the Web to increase its quality. This can happen by making the information more machine-interpretable, by describing it using (mostly) metadata. When that happens it will be possible for users to assign their tasks on Semantic Agents. Many tasks that today are done manually (for example an online booking) will be completed fully automatically by Semantic Agents.

The EuroCitizen ontology aims to provide the infrastructure for describing the common interests of European citizens, providing a way for reasoning about and querying specific citizens, etc. Follows a figure that shows a part of EuroCitizen.
